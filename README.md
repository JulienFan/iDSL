The internship of M1 - A new DSL for IoT signal synchronization 

In this project, we rely on Model-Driven Engineering to propose a new DSL (Domain Specific language) for IoT. The case study applies for healthcare field, more specifically signal synchronization between both EEG and ECG devices. The main goal is to ensure the transformation from model into Java to automatically generate executable code for simulation experiments, and into formal language LOTOS in order to rigorously check needed properties.
